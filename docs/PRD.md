## Executive Summary

Othello is a lightweight, high-performance AI agent built in Go that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to interact with external tools and services. The agent uses local Qwen2.5 models (3B/7B) to provide intelligent assistance while maintaining privacy and reducing API costs.

### Vision Statement
To create the most efficient, extensible, and user-friendly local AI agent that can seamlessly integrate with any MCP-compatible tool or service.

### Key Value Propositions
- **Performance**: Lightning-fast responses with Go's efficiency and local models
- **Privacy**: All processing happens locally, no data leaves your machine
- **Extensibility**: Easy integration with 100+ existing MCP servers
- **Cost-Effective**: No API costs for model inference
- **Deployment**: Single binary with zero dependencies
