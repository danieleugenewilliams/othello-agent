## Key Features

### 🧠 **Advanced Memory System** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Semantic Search**: AI-powered search across stored knowledge
- **Intelligent Organization**: Auto-categorization with tags and domains
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Persistent knowledge across conversations
- **Relationship Mapping**: Discover connections between memories
- **AI Analysis**: Question answering over memory collections

### 🚀 **Performance**
- **Go-powered**: Lightning-fast native performance
- **Local models**: No API latency, instant responses
- **Efficient**: <100MB memory footprint (excluding model)
- **Real-time Search**: Instant memory retrieval and display

### 🔒 **Privacy**
- **Local execution**: All processing on your machine
- **No data sharing**: Zero external data transmission
- **Offline capable**: Core functionality works without internet
- **Local memory**: All knowledge stays on your device

### 🔧 **Extensibility**
- **MCP integration**: Working tool server ecosystem
- **Memory MCP Server**: Sophisticated local-memory integration
- **Plugin system**: Easy custom tool development
- **Model flexibility**: Ollama and other backends supported

### 💰 **Cost-Effective**
- **No API costs**: Local model inference
- **Single binary**: Zero runtime dependencies
- **Efficient deployment**: Cross-platform compatibility

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Ollama for model management
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Download Qwen2.5 model
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
```

### 2. Install Othello
```bash
# Download and install binary
curl -L https://github.com/danieleugenewilliams/othello-agent/releases/latest/download/othello-$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-$(uname -m) -o othello
chmod +x othello && sudo mv othello /usr/local/bin/
```

### 3. Start Using
```bash
# Launch interactive TUI
othello

# Add your first MCP server
othello mcp add filesystem npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path/to/directory
```
