# Week 3 Preparation - Othello AI Agent

## Project Status (End of Week 2)

### âœ… Completed Infrastructure
- **MCP Integration**: Full server connection and tool discovery pipeline
- **TUI System**: Complete interface with chat, tools, servers, help, history views  
- **CLI Management**: MCP server management commands
- **Configuration**: Standard mcp.json format implementation
- **Tool Discovery**: 11 tools from local-memory server successfully registered

### ðŸŽ¯ Week 3 Objectives

#### Phase 1: Tool Call Detection System
**Goal**: Automatically detect when user messages require tool execution

**Key Features**:
- Pattern matching for tool-relevant requests
- Intent mapping to available tools  
- Smart tool recommendations
- Confirmation prompts for tool execution

**Example Scenarios**:
- User: "search my memories for machine learning" â†’ Trigger `search` tool
- User: "remember this conversation" â†’ Trigger `store_memory` tool
- User: "what tools do you have?" â†’ Display tool list

#### Phase 2: Model-Tool Integration  
**Goal**: Enable LLM to automatically use tools in responses

**Key Features**:
- Tool descriptions included in model prompts
- Response parsing for tool calls
- Automatic tool execution with result injection
- Seamless conversation flow with tool integration

**Example Flow**:
1. User asks question requiring memory search
2. Model recognizes need for tool use
3. Model outputs tool call request  
4. System executes tool automatically
5. Tool results injected into model context
6. Model provides enhanced response with tool data

### Technical Implementation Plan

#### Files to Modify/Create:
- `internal/agent/tool_detector.go` - Pattern matching and intent detection
- `internal/model/tool_integration.go` - Model-tool interface
- `internal/tui/chat_view.go` - Enhanced chat with tool suggestions
- `cmd/othello/main.go` - Tool-aware conversation flow

#### Architecture Changes:
- Extend `AgentInterface` with tool detection methods
- Add tool calling protocol to model interface
- Create conversation middleware for tool integration
- Implement tool result formatting for display

### Success Criteria
- [ ] User can trigger tools through natural language
- [ ] Model automatically suggests and uses tools
- [ ] Tool results seamlessly integrate into conversation
- [ ] Error handling for tool failures
- [ ] Clean UX for tool confirmations and results

### Ready for Week 3! ðŸš€
All infrastructure complete. Next phase focuses on intelligent tool integration.
