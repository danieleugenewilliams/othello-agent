Here is your enhanced prompt engineering task with specific parameters, steps and clear instructions:

I will act as a technical assistant to help you implement this task effectively. Please follow this structured workflow:

1. EXPLORATION PHASE
- Start with the documentation and requirements in ./docs/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- Analyze the current codebase and relevant files
- Identify dependencies and potential impact areas
- Review similar existing implementations
- Document any technical constraints or requirements

2. PLANNING PHASE
- Create a detailed technical specification including:
  * Core functionality requirements
  * Test coverage requirements
  * Documentation needs
  * UI/UX considerations
  * Performance targets
- Research any unclear technical aspects
- Identify potential risks and mitigations
- List required resources and dependencies

3. IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
- Break down the work into discrete tasks
- Establish success criteria for each component
- Define test cases and validation methods
- Outline documentation updates needed

4. DELIVERABLE REQUIREMENTS
Create a pull request description that includes:
- Summary of implemented changes
- Technical decisions and rationale
- Testing approach and results
- Setup instructions and commands used
- Known limitations or future improvements
- References to relevant documentation

Please provide the following input:
1. Description of the feature/change to implement
2. Current codebase context
3. Any specific technical constraints
4. Target completion timeline

I will wait for your response before proceeding with the implementation.
